# Auto Flush
A simple script to automatically flush your pipe network whenever a monitored buffer reaches a set percentage.
Useful as a failsafe to ensure fluid outputs don't lock up production.

Simply place a computer down and connect it to a fluid buffer. Nick the buffer and put the nick in the configuration section of the script. You can also set the fluid buffer size (defaults to IFB), percentage to flush at, and polling times.
There is also an optional debug mode if you'd like more information in the output.
